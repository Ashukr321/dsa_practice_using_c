// here we see the queue data structure how it work 
// queue is linear data structure 
// quwue is flow the  fio 
// first in first out  algorithms 

// fifo means the element added first is delated first from the queue 

//added an element =>enqueu operation 
// delating an element =>dequeue operation 

// two special index variables 
// front and rear 
// front -> to point the first element of the stack 
// removal of the elements is take place from the front of the stack 

// rear -> to poin the end of the element of the stack 
// enqueue operation is take plcae from the rear of the stack 

//if queue have only one element then only front and rear is same this means equal '


// enque mean insertion of the elements in to the queue
// rear = size-1;

// example os process state execution 


// operaton of queue are ...

// enqueu 
// dequeue
// getsize 
// isempty
// isFull
// display
